## Description

Open source Minesweeper game (configurable) totally written in DHTML (HTML, CSS and JavaScript).

It is my sixth DHTML game and was made in mid 2006.

Players can configure the game with some options. You can change the number of mines, board size and set a time limit (in seconds) or disable it.

You can also change the game behaviour easily by editing many of the configuration variables which are at the beginning of the script. To change the game images you just need to replace them with others.

Official languages are Spanish and English.

You can find other modified and adapted versions of this game on the Internet, including one Opera widget.

This game has been tested under BeOS, Linux, NetBSD, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Windows, Mac OS X, BlackBerry Tablet OS, Android, iOS and others.
